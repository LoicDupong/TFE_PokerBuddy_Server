# PokerBuddy ♠️  
**Home poker nights, made simple.**

PokerBuddy is a web application designed to help players **organize, run, and track home poker sessions**.  
It centralizes everything needed before, during, and after a game night — from session creation to in-game tools and long-term statistics.
